    Dear parents/Guardians<br/>
    I would like to welcome you to our school website. It is designed to give you a glimpse of our school and is packed with information that you as parents and carers will need to know. The website has information on all the aspects of our school including Safeguarding, admissions criteria, times of the school day, school uniform and before and after school care. 

At little rock schools, we have a very strong vision which forms a fundamental part of how we move the school forward and we have nine values which underpin this vision. Our vision was written with input from all our school staff and our school head office. Our school has a very dedicated team of staff who work exceptionally hard to ensure each child achieves their best, they are fully supported by the members of our Governing Body.
    </p>
    <p>
    Meetings for prospective parents who would like to learn more about our school are held several times during the year. Please contact the school office if you would like to attend one. We hold them for both prospective Nursery and Reception parents.
    </p>
    <p>
    As a primary school, we believe that young children learn best when they are stimulated by an exciting and challenging curriculum which motivates them to learn. Our ethos is that we actively encourage children to be inquisitive about the world around them and we celebrate every child’s success. Our aim is to create a lifelong love of learning in every child. Our school motto is ‘We prepare are children for the future.’ Our most recent achievements was in the common entrance examinations both federal and private our pupils were graded as outstanding. We were also graded as outstanding in the recent inter-school quiz and debating in May 2019.
    </p>
    <p>
    At little rock schools we have high expectations of all our children both in terms of behaviour and learning. Lessons are planned according to the variety of abilities within each class. Teachers use a range of teaching styles to ensure all children are actively involved in lessons and aim for every child to achieve their full potential.
    </p>
    <p>
    As a school, we greatly value the views of the school community and throughout the year provide opportunities for both children and parents to contribute their ideas which we then use to help us plan for the future of the school. Each class has two school councillors who meet with the Head teacher to discuss their ideas about issues such keeping safe, choosing which charities the school should support and how to become a better ‘Eco school’.
    </p>
    <p>
    Little Rock Nursery & Primary Schools provides a happy, welcoming and caring environment for children throughout the years they are with us.
    </p>
    <p>
    I look forward to meeting you during the year.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>Mr I.B Okafor & Mrs Ify Okafor.</p>
    
<p>Chairman & Administrator of Little Rock Schools.</p>
