    <p>
    In Reception One, your child will follow the Little Rock School Early Stage curriculum. This sets the standards for the learning, development, and care of your child. The things your child will learn in Reception one have been organised into three prime areas of learning:
<list>
<li>Communication and Language</li>
<li>Physical Development</li>
<li>Personal and Social Development.</li>
Don’t be too concerned if your child says that they have been playing all day – it just means that they have been lucky enough to have experienced staff who have made their learning fun and enjoyable! As the Reception year progresses, the learning may start to become more formal, ready for reception two and the National Curriculum.

    <p>
    In Reception two your child will be assessed regularly. This is to check their progress and identify the next steps in their learning. The school may carry out a baseline assessment when your child starts to find out what they can do already. This is nothing to worry about – it is not a test and it is unlikely your child will even know it is happening. At the end of Reception two, your child’s teacher will assess again and it is likely they will complete an EYFS Profile. This assessment is carried out by the Reception teacher and is based on what they, and other staff caring for your child, have observed over a period of time. All of the information collected is then used to assess where your child is currently in the seven areas of learning.

    Leaving Reception behind and moving into Nursery One can feel like a big step for both children and their parents, but a good school will make the transition an easy one.

Your child will still be learning through play, they will still be exploring, discovering and making plenty of use of their role-play corner.Your child’s day may be a little more structured than it was in Reception and they may have to sit at a table for a little longer than they are used to, but they will still also be learning in a variety of ways; while moving, exploring outdoors, in groups, on the carpet or walking around the school!

With colorful read-aloud texts, fun projects, and interactive online learning, our Nursery 2 curriculum creates a vibrant learning experience for young learners.
Designed to develop the foundational skills students will need in 1st Grade, our program weaves reading and writing instruction and practice throughout the curriculum.
Using our integrated approach, students will develop critical thinking skills for reading while learning phonics skills such as rhyming and word patterns in context. These skills will be further reinforced as they begin to learn formal printing skills.
Using the research-based British Math Method, our Nursery two math course will help your students develop strong number sense, mental math, and problem-solving skills. Perhaps most importantly, these lessons make learning Math fun!
