      An outstanding feature of the school continues to be the very strong sense of community that prevails. Teachers and parents share a joint responsibility for helping each child develop his or her talents and abilities and consequently strong partnerships are forged between the home and school environments. Parental involvement in all facets of the school is always welcomed and valued.

Our exiting students graduate in Grade 5 armed with the skills and learning experiences to make informed choices, have an appreciation of the world they live in and are able to fully participate as active global citizens who really want to make a difference.
